# üåç UrbanMinds - Sustainable Urban Planning

## üöÄ NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024: Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements

UrbanMinds is a **lightweight and powerful** platform for geospatial data visualization that makes critical urban environmental indicators accessible to everyone. By consuming data in **real-time** directly from the **NASA GIBS** (Global Imagery Browse Services) service, the project removes technical barriers, allowing urban planners and citizens to monitor their city's health instantly and efficiently.

## ‚ú® Analyzed Indicators (NASA Data)

We focus on three essential pillars for quality of life and urban resilience, utilizing global and up-to-date NASA data:

| Indicator | NASA Data (Product) | Urban Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heat Islands** | Land Surface Temperature (LST) | Maps surface heat, essential for mitigating thermal stress in vulnerable neighborhoods. |
| **Air Pollution** | Nitrogen Dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) Concentration | Assesses air quality, crucial for respiratory health and traffic planning. |
| **Vegetation Health** | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) | Indicates vegetation density and health, fundamental for green space planning and carbon absorption. |

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture and Aurora AI

UrbanMinds adopts a **Frontend-Driven** architecture that ensures robustness and low operational cost, complemented by our intelligent analysis engine.

### ü§ñ Aurora: The Heart of the Resolution

In addition to data visualization, the platform integrates a problem analysis module called **Aurora**.

* **Functionality:** **Aurora** is our Artificial Intelligence designed to receive an infrastructure problem provided by the user and generate a **resolution** or sustainable development suggestion, connecting local issues to practical, eco-friendly solutions.

### Core Technology Stack

* **Frontend (SPA):** `HTML`, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **TailwindCSS** for agile interface development.
* **Map Service:** **Leaflet.js** for efficient interactive map rendering.
* **Location Search:** **Leaflet Control Geocoder** (using Nominatim/OpenStreetMap) for global city searching.

### üí° Data Innovation: Real-Time Consumption (WMS)

The most robust feature of the architecture is that **no NASA data is downloaded or permanently stored**.

* The project consumes data layers in real-time directly via the **WMS (Web Map Service)** protocol of the **NASA GIBS** service.
* **Advantage:** This eliminates the need for complex download *scripts*, data processing, and permanently resolves issues with broken links or outdated data. The platform always displays the latest visualization available from NASA.

### Minimalist Backend

* **Backend:** A **Flask (Python)** micro-server.
* **Single Function:** Its sole responsibility is to serve the main page (`index.html`) and static code, keeping the server's complexity and carbon footprint extremely low.
